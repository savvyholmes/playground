## Markdown in GitHub
This is just a markdown file -- you can learn more about [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) here. Once you have your github account set up (and git installed on your computer), maybe try cloning this repository to your computer, add something to this markdown file, commit it and push it back up. Just for fun...

For example -- maybe answer a few questions...

### Instruments you play? If you don't play an instrument, instrument you wish you could play?

* Michele: mandolin (pretty well), banjo (pretty poorly); also a tiny bit of clarinet (from high school, but have recently learned I can still play it while trying to accompany my teenage baritone player), and some piano (but not enough to keep my fingers in shape) -- mostly it's mando
* Savvy: I grew up singing which always led to the joke of what instrument I played was my throat :) I also had a solo in third grade playing Hot Cross Buns.  

### Animals in your life? If you haven't had the pleasure of an aninmal companion, animals you hope to one day know?

* Michele: Currently, 3 dogs, 2 cats, 3 chickens; formerly, 3 other dogs, 2 other cats, and numerous other chickens (some of whom have met a rather grisly end; just the chickens, not the dogs and cats); someday, I hope to have a donkey, or maybe a goat
* Savvy: I currently have two pups in my life, however, had many dogs growing up. Also, oddly enough, I had about 30 bunnies and 50 guinea pigs - in addition to 2 hamsters, and a chinchilla. Also big fan of bird watching.
